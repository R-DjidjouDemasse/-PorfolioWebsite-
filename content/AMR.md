(<p><img src="/uploads/Fig-MutationPlasmids.pdf" alt="Fig-MutationPlasmids" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;">)
A generic within-host microbial dynamics model combining  mutational processes, horizontal gene transfer and resource consumption. It describes interactions dynamics of four bacterial strains: one fully sensitive to the drug, one with mutational resistance only, one with plasmidic resistance only and one with both resistances. With respect to the order in the set of  strainâ€™s effective reproduction thresholds numbers, the qualitative dynamics of the model range from the extinction of all strains, coexistence of sensitive and mutational resistance strains to the coexistence of all strains at equilibrium.
