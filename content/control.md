<p>One of the characteristics of HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) transmission is the age structure of the host population and the vertical transmission of the disease. The infection is transmitted directly from infected mother to an embryo, fetus, or baby during pregnancy or childbirth (the perinatal infection). Further, symptomatic and asymptomatic HBV infections are age-dependent and the risk of asymptomatic HBV infection is inversely related to age at infection. By formulating an age-structured model for the transmission dynamics of HBV with differential infectivity: symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and using optimal control theory, we find that an optimal control strategy is a combination of immunization of young adults (at least susceptible with the age less than 5 years old) and treatment of HBV symptomatic infections. We also observe that mass vaccination in infants increases the average age of infection in unimmunized individuals and shifts the average age at infection to older age groups.</p>

<p> The monomorphic concentration phenomenon at the evolutionary equilibrium illustrates above is not generaly verify in the case of host heteregeneous environment. That is because the the optimization principle holds only for some configurations, and the shape of R0 function does not allow to characterize evolutionary attractors. The Pairwise Invasibility Plot (PIP) must be used instead. As illustrate below, we have a polymorphic pathogen population at equilibrium in different proportions (panels d,e) but only one local maximum for the R0 as confirmed by the gradient (panels b,c). However, the PIP predicts a polymorphic population (panel a). Indeed, singular strategies, muS and muR, are respectively branching point and evolutionarily stable (no nearby mutant can invade) ([Djidjou-Demasse et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/423467v2.full.pdf)).</p>
