>We focus on population dynamics, usually of host-natural enemy interactions, to understand fundamental processes in epidemiology, ecology and evolution of infectious disease. Our works are based on a combination of Mathematical analysis and Modeling with a particular focus on Dynamical Systems. 

## Population dynamics
By involving many fields (mathematics, social sciences, biology), the aim here is to describe variations over time of biological systems. These systems involve a time variable and one or more structuring variables (time since infection, chronological age, space, phenotypic trait, etc.).  In a deterministic framework, these systems are usually described by ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations), DDEs (Delayed Differential Equations) or PDEs (Partial Derivative Equations). Their study is based on dynamical systems theory.

## Scientific computing 
Quite often, a very high complexity (i.e., too strong nonlinearity) of the modeling problem leads to situations where it is difficult to conduct a complete mathematical analysis of the model dynamics. In such cases, it is useful to be able to use the techniques of scientific calculation. It is a discipline that allows a complete numerical experimentation of the model by bringing together a set of mathematical and computer science tools.</p>

<h2>Equal Height Boxes</h2>
<p>Floating boxes with equal heights:</p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="box" style="background-color:#bbb">
  <h2>Box 1</h2>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  </div>
  <div class="box" style="background-color:#ccc">
  <h2>Box 2</h2>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div class="box" style="background-color:#ccc">
  <h2>Box 2</h2>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  <p>Some content, some content, some content</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This example not very flexible. It is ok to use CSS height if you can guarantee that the boxes will always have the same amount of content in them, but that's not always the case. If you try the example above on a mobile phone (or resize the browser window), you will see that the second box's content will be displayed outside of the box.</p>
