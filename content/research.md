>We focus on population dynamics, usually of host-natural enemy interactions, to understand fundamental processes in epidemiology, ecology and evolution of infectious disease. Our works are based on a combination of Mathematical analysis and Modeling with a particular focus on Dynamical Systems. 

## Population dynamics
By involving many fields (mathematics, social sciences, biology), the aim here is to describe variations over time of biological systems. These systems involve a time variable and one or more structuring variables (time since infection, chronological age, space, phenotypic trait, etc.).  In a deterministic framework, these systems are usually described by ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations), DDEs (Delayed Differential Equations) or PDEs (Partial Derivative Equations). Their study is based on dynamical systems theory.

## Scientific computing
<img align="left" width="300" height="200" src="/SEAIR_COVID_severe.svg"> Quite often, a very high complexity (i.e., too strong nonlinearity) of the modeling problem leads to situations where it is difficult to conduct a complete mathematical analysis of the model dynamics. In such cases, it is useful to be able to use the techniques of scientific calculation. It is a discipline that allows a complete numerical experimentation of the model by bringing together a set of mathematical and computer science tools.
