>We focus on population dynamics, usually of host-natural enemy interactions, to understand fundamental processes in epidemiology, ecology and evolution of infectious disease. Our works are based on a combination of Mathematical analysis and Modeling with a particular focus on Dynamical Systems. 

## Population dynamics
By involving many fields (mathematics, social sciences, biology), the aim here is to describe variations over time of biological systems. These systems involve a time variable and one or more structuring variables (time since infection, chronological age, space, phenotypic trait, etc.).  In a deterministic framework, these systems are usually described by ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations), DDEs (Delayed Differential Equations) or PDEs (Partial Derivative Equations). Their study is based on dynamical systems theory.



## Scientific computing
Quite often, a very high complexity (i.e., too strong nonlinearity) of the modeling problem leads to situations where it is difficult to conduct a complete mathematical analysis of the model dynamics. In such cases, it is useful to be able to use the techniques of scientific calculation. It is a discipline that allows a complete numerical experimentation of the model by bringing together a set of mathematical and computer science tools.

We study evolutionary dynamics of a population, for e.g., by taking into account mutation or selection processes. Here, a focus is on integro-differential equations with nonlocal terms.</p>

<h2>[Human malaria](/malaria.html)</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/HumanMalaria.jpg" alt="HumanMalaria" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;">
The host-vector pairing is a fundamental relationship in the transmission and evolution of malaria parasites. Through the bacterial diversity within a host, different parasitic forms and environmental impact on the evolution of the vector, we develop models at both within- and between-host scales to better understand mechanisms favouring the persistence of this disease.</p>

<h2>[Optimal control of infectious diseases](/control.html)</h2>
<p><img src="/uploads/Control.jpg" alt="Control" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin-right:15px;">
Management or control of an outbreak is a priority for both public health concerns and environmental considerations. Optimal control theory is a tremendous means for studying and proposing decision support tools. We develop works around this theory for infectious diseases such as COVID-19, HIV or HBV.</p>
