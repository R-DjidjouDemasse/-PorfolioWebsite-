Evolutionary epidemiology dynamics, particularly for spore producing pathogens, is here describe integro-differential
equation with nonlocal mutation terms. Parasites reproduce clonally and each strain is characterized by several pathogenicity traits corresponding to the basic infection steps (eg., infection efficiency, latent period, sporulation capacity depending on the age of infection). The basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$</p>
