Evolutionary epidemiology dynamics, particularly for spore producing pathogens, is here describe by integro-differential
equations with nonlocal mutation terms. Parasites reproduce clonally and each strain is characterized by several pathogenicity traits corresponding to the basic infection steps (eg., infection efficiency, latent period, sporulation capacity depending on the age of infection). In a host homegenous environement, here the basic reproduction number (R0) can be used to study the spread of a new mutant strain in a host population already infected by a resident strain, and to characterize pathogen's evolutionary attractors among a large number of pathogen strains. The joint epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics illustrates the concentration of the pathogen population around a unique evolutionary attractor (which is characterized by the R0). Before reaching this phenotype, the pathogen population lives
during certain time around the initial dominant phenotype and then shifts by mutation and lives for a relatively long time around a local maximum of the R0. </p>
