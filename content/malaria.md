<p> We develop models to describe the within-host dynamics of different *plasmodi* such as *P. falciparum*, *P. Vivax* or *P. Malariae*. For the parasitized stage of red blood cells (RBCs), we consider an age-structured dynamics, where the age is a continuous variable representing the time since the concerned RBC is parasitized. Such a continuous age structure allow to track the maturity and the different stages of sequestrated parasites, but also to have a refined description of the parasitized RBC rupture and of the merozoites release phenomenon ([Djidjou-Demasse & Ducrot](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260163056_An_Age-Structured_Within-Host_Model_for_Multistrain_Malaria_Infections)). Further, such a model easily allows to include anti-malarial treatments acting on some particular stages of the development of the parasites into the parasitized RBCs. Using gametocyte production as a proxy variable of infectiousness, we found the age-structured model to perform best in representing the gametocyte dynamics compared to the classical K-compartments of ordinary differential equations ([Djidjou-Demasse et al.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03030234)). </p>

<p> At the epidemiological level, we are also developing malaria transmission models with seasonal mosquito life-history traits such as: periodic-mosquitoes per capita birth rate, -mosquitoes death rate, -probability of mosquito to human disease transmission, -probability of human to mosquito disease transmission and -mosquitoes biting rate. In addition to some interesting math results, the model outputs are in accordance with the seasonal variation of the reported cases of a malaria-epidemic region, e.g., in Mpumalanga province in South Africa ([Djidjou-Demasse et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338233368_Development_and_analysis_of_a_malaria_transmission_mathematical_model_with_seasonal_mosquito_life-history_traits)). </p>
