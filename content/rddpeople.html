2. You can also put HTML in a markdown file and use the .md extension.  The Blackfriday markdown standard used in HUGO allows HTML to be placed in the markdown.  It just ignores the HTML when converting the markdown, assuming that it's already ready for primetime.  In fact, you can just put HTML in a markdown file and you'll be good.

**But, also consider this...**
More static site generators are using (encouraging) markdown as the means of content entry.  This scared me at first, but after thinking about it, I concluded that using markdown actually may strengthen the quality of the content. Markdown is easy to learn and can be actually easier to read than HTML (though mileage may vary).  My point is, using markdown encourages you to concentrate more on your content, which can make a stunning difference on your site.

If you do have markup and need more complex items like a YouTube vid, twitter card, etc..., you can use shortcodes. They're almost exactly like the ones used in Wordpress and Hugo comes packaged natively with a handful of them.  Check the docs, though. They are extremely simple to write and can allow you to functionally componentize your presentation tier, keeping it dry and less complicated.

Hit me if you have questions, but HTML isn't a problem at all.
